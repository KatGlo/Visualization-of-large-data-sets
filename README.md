## 📚 Contents

### 📌 **Exercise 1 – PCA & Kernel PCA**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Linear dimensionality reduction technique used for extracting essential features and reducing noise.
- **Kernel PCA**: Extends PCA to nonlinear cases, allowing better separation and visualization of complex patterns.

### 📌 **Exercise 2 – Advanced Dimensionality Reduction Techniques**
Exploration of popular advanced embedding algorithms:

- **MDS (Multidimensional Scaling)** – Preserving distances between samples.
- **t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)** – Nonlinear method, especially good for local structure visualization.
- **UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)** – Efficient, preserves both local and global structures.
- **TriMAP** – Improved global structure visualization.
- **PaCMAP** – Balances preservation of local and global relationships effectively.
